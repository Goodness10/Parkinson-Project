Symptoms usually begin gradually and worsen over time. As the disease progresses, people may have difficulty walking and talking. They may also have mental and behavioral changes, sleep problems, depression, memory difficulties, and fatigue.

This project is aimed at prediction those that are likely to have the diseases using the features. The features that affected the model the most are: (PPE, spread1, MDVP:Jitter(Abs), MDVP:Fo(Hz), spread2, MDVP:APQ , MDVP:Flo(Hz), MDVP:Fhi(Hz), HNR , Shimmer:APQ5)
- Measures of fundamental frequency variation
- Average vocal fundamental frequency 
- Measures of variation in fundamental frequency
- Minimum vocal fundamental frequency
- Maximum vocal fundamental frequency
- Measures of variation in amplitude
